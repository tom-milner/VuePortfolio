## About
Hi. I'm Tom, a developer based in Guildford, UK.

I make websites and apps, and have experience with modern web development technologies (Vue, Node.JS etc) aswell as backend technologies like Java, which I have used to build scientific desktop applications in the past.

I enjoy learning and keeping up with new languages and software development trends, and I love to build all kinds of software, so contact me below!
